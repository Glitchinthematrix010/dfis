Digital Forensic Investigative Scripts

Simply a collection of the more useful scripts I've created for
use during my forensic investigations.  They're mostly Perl and
generally I use them from a Linux investigative platform.
Many of the scripts have dependencies on external tools like
the Sleuthkit.

Documentation is sadly lacking.  I have plans for a series of
blog posts that discuss the finer points of using these tools.
But I figured it was better to get the code out there than wait
for documentation.  The scripts do at least have command-line
help built in and internal commentary in some cases.

In the meantime, if you have any questions please feel free to
contact me via email.
