Digital Forensic Investigative Scripts

Simply a collection of the more generally useful scripts I've created
for use during my forensic investigations.  They're mostly Perl and
generally I use them from a Linux investigative platform.  Many of the
scripts have dependencies on external tools like the Sleuthkit.

Documentation is sadly lacking.  I have plans for a series of blog
posts that discuss the finer points of using these tools.  But I
figured it was better to get the code out there than wait for
documentation.  The scripts do at least have command-line help built
in and internal commentary in some cases.

The original version of the frib/fib tools are documented here:

There have been some updates to frib/fib since these presentations,
adding some new functionality.  But the tools basically work the same.

If you have questions about any of these tools, please feel free to 
contact me via email.
